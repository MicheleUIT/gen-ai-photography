## Idea

The beauty of a photo, a painting, or other works of art, is of course subjective.

Even though the matter remains highly subjective, as said earlier, in photography there are some non-normative "rules" that are generally considered to produce images more pleasing to the human eye. One such rule is the [rule of thirds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds).

Are images generated by AI esthetically pleasing?
If so, can we use AI's artistic power to improve (or suggest how to improve) pictures taken by humans?

## Tasks

Here is a list of tasks:
1. Review the literature on the esthetic sense of image-generating AI models.
2. If image-generating models do have an esthetic sense, can we exploit that to have a way to computationally measure the esthetic value of an image?
3. Design a pipeline that, provided an input image, would change it so that it follows the rule of thirds.
4. Design a chatbot that provides hints on how to improve an image.

The submitted report, with more details on the above tasks, is contained in `report.ipynb`.

## Running the reframing pipeline

To run the reframing pipeline, execute `main.py`. Make sure to change the variable `img_path` to the path of your chosen image. By default, `img_path` is set with an example image, which you can also use.

```python
# Example usage
img_path = "report_images\Example_objects.png"  # Change this to your image path

```
After excecution just follow instructions in terminal or comand prompt. 

The pipeline has been tested with JPG and PNG images, but other formats might work as well.
