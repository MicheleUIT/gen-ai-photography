    "The reframing pipeline's objective is to identify the subject within an image and then modify the image accordingly. This modification involves shifting and zooming to align the subjects with the thirds. In the process of shifting and zooming, parts of the image that were previously outside the frame may become visible. To ensure a complete and visually appealing image, these newly visible areas are filled in using an image restoration technique known as inpainting. Inpainting effectively reconstructs the lost or deteriorated parts of the image, resulting in a well-framed and complete image. To use this pipeline run main.py but need first define path to image."
